He was academic visitor at the Information Systems Department, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA.

He received his PhD degree in Information Management from Universidade Nova de Lisboa (UNL), Portugal in 2011. He also received Master degree in Statistics and Information Management from NOVA IMS, Portugal, in 2006 and a degree in Industrial Engineering and Management from Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Universidade Técnica de Lisboa (UTL), Portugal, in 2001. Before joining academia he worked in the Private Sector as a Product Management and Account Management in the largest Portuguese Information Technology Company, Portugal Telecom.

His research is driven by the vision to marry information technology (IT) with the process of innovation diffusion (initiation, adoption, use, and value) across all adoption units (individuals, firms, and societies). With this research I intend to shed transcending on the most important antecedents of IT innovation, being capable of developing new toolkits for emerging IT. In the last five years I have worked on IT adoption models. For individuals as adoption units, I am interested in understanding what drives the adoption of e-health, e-banking, m-banking, and m-payments. At firm-level, I first focused on Internet adoption, followed by e-business adoption, enterprise resource planning (ERP) use and value (in collaboration with Microsoft Corporation), cloud computing adoption stages, and cloud computing value (also with Microsoft Corporation and SAP). Another field of interest is the e-government and e-participation adoption by citizens. I am also interested in assessing the role of IT in the development of countries and understanding the digital divide. I developed for the European Commission a framework for improving the level of cross-border e-commerce within the European Union.
